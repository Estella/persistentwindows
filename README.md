This is a fork of http://www.ninjacrab.com/persistent-windows/

Changes are:
- Better high DPI support especially in mixed-DPI configurations
- Lower CPU usage

Requires Windows 10 Creators Update

Note this still isn't perfect, it gets sizing wrong for Modern apps and certain other apps (e.g. Thunderbird). Still does a better job than Display Fusion though!


2019 update
===========

If you want a solution that works reliably, check out http://www.stefandidak.com/windows-layout-manager/

It may be nearly a decade old, but it supports mixed and high DPI on the latest Windows 10 perfectly, and has no quirks with any applications.
